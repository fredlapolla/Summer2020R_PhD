## Group Work

Try to make a histogram of center time and a histogram of task time on day 1. Are these normally distributed? Are they skewed, and if so, which way?

```{r}

```

## Group Work

Make a box plot of body weight by sex, for these mice. Are they likely the same for both groups?

```{r}

```

## Group Work

Make a qq plot of task time on day one. Also make one for body weight. Would you expect either of these to be normal or skewed? How can you tell?

```{r}

```

## Group Work

If we wanted to make a scatter plot of errors on day 1 vs activity, how would we do it? Based on what you now know about assessing skew, what test might we run for this?

```{r}

```
